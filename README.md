# Hello-world

Hi Humans:

I heard about Github for a long time. In the past I was doing some work about Verilog, but I want to learn something about machine learning so I started to use Github right now. I am really a green hand. Hoping that everyone can bear my stupid mistakes.

Thanks

Today is my first day to pull my effort on Mzmine into Github! The feeling of devoting to Opensource Community is amazing! Also, I want to use LeetCode to improve my coding skills.

The sad point is that I fail some interviews. And it is hard to make other believe that although I come from physics major, I can also write code fluently. And I have not recceived more admission from graduate school...

Thanks
